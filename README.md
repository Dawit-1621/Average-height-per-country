## Average Height per Country – Data Cleaning

This repository contains my contribution to the Datopian Open Data Engineering Challenge. The task is to process publicly available datasets on average human height per country and produce a cleaned, standardized dataset.

Project Overview

I integrated three data sources :-
* Wikipedia – Average height by country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_human_height_by_country)
* Disabled World – Human Height Averages (https://www.disabled-world.com/calculators-charts/height-chart.php)
* NCD-RisC – Global BMI and Height Data (https://www.ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-height.html)

The result is a single, clean dataset with country, year, sex, and average height in centimeters.
